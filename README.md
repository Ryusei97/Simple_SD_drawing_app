# Simple_SD_drawing_app
This app is a simple drawing and image generation application built with Tkinter and Python. Users can draw freehand on a canvas using various colors and brush sizes. Additionally, they can enter a text prompt, and generate images based on both the drawn content and the provided text prompt using an img2img stable diffusion model.

Install the necessary packages and run `main.py` to test the image generation. The model parameters can be adjusted by editing the code directly.
